## What is this?
This is a university assignment. The task is to create a REST API for a mail server. The API should be able to create, read, update, and delete. It is not a full-fledged mail server, but a simple API that can be used to create users and retrieve them. Do not use this for anything but educational purposes. Passwords are handled in cleartext and there is no user authentication. To cite tech entusiasts from XDA:
> Your warranty is now void.   
> I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed.   
> Please do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this ROM before flashing it!  
> YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you. [^xda]

Needless to say, this quote is not for __this__ project, but for custom ROMs, but the spirit of the quote still stands as is.

## Setup instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Make sure you have Java JDK 20 or above installed.
4. Make sure you have Maven installed.
5. Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.
6. Create a new PostgreSQL database for the project.
7. Update the `application.properties` file with your PostgreSQL database connection details. For example:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database_name
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```
   The default one in this project is username=`postgres` and password=`password`. The database name is `mailserver`.
8. Run the application using your IDE or by executing the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   If this does not work, go to the root directory of the project and open a terminal in which you write:

    ```cmd
    .\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
    ```
   ... and hit Enter.

9. The application should start, and you can access the REST API at `http://localhost:8080/api/`.
10. You can use Postman or any other API testing tool to interact with the API endpoints.
11. You can also use the URL bar in your browser to retrieve information. This is not recommended for `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` methods, but it works for `GET` methods.


## Create 
### Create a user `POST`

<details>
<summary>
Using Postman
</summary>

1. Open Postman and create a new HTTPS workspace if you don't already have one
2. We want to create a user so choose the <code>POST</code> label under the REST API basics: CRUD, test & variable dropdown menu.
3. Enter the URL http://localhost:8080/api/users in the address bar
4. In the body field, make sure raw JSON is selected.
5.
   ```json
   {
     "username": "john_doe",
     "email": "john_doe@email.com",
     "password": "password"
   }
   ```

6. Press the <code>Send</code> button.
   If you see the number <code>200</code> in a toast everything went as expected. If you see something else, something went wrong.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Using the URL bar
</summary>

‚òùÔ∏èü§ì This is unsupported and not recommended. You can only __retrieve__ (`GET`) information from the URL bar.

</details>

### Create email `POST`
<details>
<summary>Using Postman</summary>

1. Make sure you've chosen POST in your Postman workspace.

    ```json
    {
        "fromEmail":"johndoe@email.com",
        "toEmail":"janesmith@email.com",
        "subject":"HOA Terms and conditions",
        "body":"Blablabla legal mumbojumbo see attachment"
    }
    ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Using the URL bar
</summary>

You can only retrieve information from the URL bar, you can not `POST`, `PUT` or `DELETE`. Even on YouTube, this is the case. Let's try to change the title of someone's video. First we need the video ID. The arguments for YouTube are `watch`. Watch what? `v` for video. So `youtube.com/watch?v={videoID}` lets us watch that video. This equals the `GET` method. First we need to get the video-ID of the video we want to change the title of. Get the [video ID here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). Then change the `watch` keyword to `edit` and hit enter.

</details>

## Delete

### Delete user `DELETE`
<details>
